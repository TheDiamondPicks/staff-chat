# Ultra Simple Staff Chat
*A small staff chat plugin with multiple ranks*
<br>This is a small plugin that allows staff members to communicate directly with certain members.
<br>This was originally made for my private server but now has been made open source.

I use Maven 3 for compilation so all you need to do after installing maven is to clone this repo and run ```mvn clean install```
